# Fitness App Microservices

A comprehensive **Microservices-based Fitness Application** built using Java Spring Boot, Spring Cloud services, and a modern frontend. This project demonstrates real-world design and implementation of a distributed system where each service is responsible for a specific domain of functionality — such as user management, activity tracking, gateway routing, service discovery, and frontend UI.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases how to build a scalable fitness platform using a microservices architecture.

Microservices provide:

- Modular development with independently deployable services  
- Better scalability and fault isolation  
- A real-world structure that mirrors enterprise applications using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud principles

## 📋 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Java 11+  
- Maven  
- Node.js  
- Git

## 🧱 Backend Setup

1. Open backend services in **IntelliJ**
2. Navigate to each service folder  
3. Build and run:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Recommended Startup Order
nginx
Copy code
configserver → eureka → gateway → userservice → activityservice → aiservice
🖥️ Frontend Setup
Open fitness-app-frontend in VS Code

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
🧪 Testing
Run backend tests using:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
📁 Environment Configuration
For local development, create .env files under respective folders if required.

Example:

ini
Copy code
API_GATEWAY=http://localhost:8080
USER_SERVICE=http://localhost:8081
